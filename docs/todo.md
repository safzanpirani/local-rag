- [ ] Parallelize Document Embeddings
- [ ] Swap to OpenAI compatible endpoints
- [ ] Allow Usage of Ollama hosted embeddings
- [ ] Enable support for additional LLM backends
    - [ ] Local AI
    - [ ] TabbyAPI
- [ ] Remove File Type Limitations for Uploads

### User Experience

- [x] Show Loaders in UI (File Uploads, Conversions, ...)

    - [ ] chunk_overlap
- [ ] Additional Error Handling
    - [x] Starting a chat without an Ollama model set
    - [ ] Non-existent GitHub repos
    - [ ] Non-existent Embedding models
    - [ ] System Level Errors (CUDA OOM,)

### Code Quality

- [x] Refactor main.py into submodules
- [ ] Refactor file processing logic
- [x] Refactor README
- [x] Implement Log Library
- [x] Improve Logging
- [ ] Re-write Docstrings
- [ ] Tests

### Known Issues & Bugs

- [ ] **HIGH PRIORITY:** Upon sending a Chat message, the File Processing expander appears to re-run itself (seems something is not using state correctly)
- [ ] Refreshing the page loses all state (expected Streamlit behavior; need to implement local-storage)
- [x] Files can be uploaded before Ollama config is set, leading to embedding errors
- [x] Assuming Ollama is hosted on localhost, Models are automatically loaded and selected, but the dropdown does not render the selected option
